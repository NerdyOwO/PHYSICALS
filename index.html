					<p id ="nilalaman" align="center"> Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is strongly linked to the worsening of melasma, making photoprotection a central strategy in managing the condition. Photoprotection spans a range of interventions, from topical sunscreens and physical barriers to oral antioxidants and lifestyle changes. By blocking the molecular and cellular damage caused by UV exposure, photoprotection not only reduces melasma triggers but also enhances the effectiveness of other treatment methods.<br> <br>
	Evidence from clinical studies supports this approach. For example, research in India showed that patients with melasma who used a broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF 19, PA+++) for 12 weeks experienced significant improvements. These included measurable reductions in melasma severity, reflected in the Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI), and better patient-reported outcomes in quality of life, assessed through Hi-MELASQOL (High Melasma Quality of Life index).<br> <br>
	The chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of photoprotection in melasma. It explores the biological mechanisms by which UV radiation influences melasma, reviews available preventive and therapeutic measures, and highlights the importance of evidence-based recommendations. By understanding and applying these strategies, clinicians can help patients achieve more effective disease management.<br><br>
	Ultimately, robust photoprotection tailored to melasma not only prevents flare-ups but also empowers patients with practical tools to cope with UV-related challenges, improving both treatment results and overall quality of life.<br> <br> </p>
