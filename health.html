                    1. Keep the product in a shaded area which maintains a dry environment to protect it from
					direct sunlight exposure. <br>Sunscreen protection factor (SPF) becomes less effective when exposed to heat and light. <br><br>

					2. Check the expiration date because sunscreen products remain effective for 12 months after opening the container.<br><br>

					3. Avoid touching your eyes with this product. You should wash your eyes right away with clean skin or acne issues.<br><br>

					4. The product should not be applied to skin areas that are damaged or severely inflamed whenever sunscreen enters your eyes.<br><br>

					5. Perform a patch test before using the product completely when you have sensitive skin.<br><br>

					6. The product should remain inaccessible to children under six years old.

                    The <b>Luxe Organix 5-in-1 UV Pro Whitening Serum Sunscreen SPF 47 PA+++ </b>is a multifunctional mineral 
					sunscreen and serum hybrid designed to provide five key benefits: sun protection, skin whitening, moisturizing, 
					acne care, and anti-aging. It uses <b>Zinc Oxide </b>and <b>Titanium Dioxide </b>as mineral filters, delivering <b>SPF 47 (sometimes 
					labeled as SPF 50) and PA+++ </b>protection for both UVA and UVB rays. Its lightweight, non-greasy, and non-sticky texture 
					makes it suitable for daily use, with additional water and sweat resistance for improved durability throughout the day.<br><br>
					
					Beyond sun protection, the formula includes <b>Alpha Melight™ </b>and <b>Niacinamide</b>, both well-known brightening agents that help address hyperpigmentation, 
					melasma, and dark spots. For anti-aging support, it features<b> Adenosine, Niacinamide, </b>and botanicals like <b>Centella Asiatica,</b> which contribute to 
					reducing fine lines and improving skin resilience. While the moisturizing effect is modest due to the presence of humectants (such as glycerin) 
					and emollients (silicones), it is still recommended to pair it with an additional moisturizer for dry skin.<br><br>
					
					The product also claims to support acne care, is dermatologically tested, fragrance-free, and coral reef-safe, broadening its appeal to 
					sensitive skin users. However, as with most mineral sunscreens, there may be a risk of a visible white cast, especially on deeper skin tones. 
					User feedback generally highlights its <b>lightweight </b>and <b>comfortable finish</b>, making it a practical choice for daily wear. For best results, it 
					should be applied as the<b> last step in the morning skincare routine</b>, reapplied every two hours or after sweating/swimming, and removed 
					thoroughly at the end of the day with double cleansing or a makeup remover.
