                    Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is strongly linked to the worsening of melasma, making photoprotection a central strategy in managing the condition. Photoprotection spans a range of interventions, from topical sunscreens and physical barriers to oral antioxidants and lifestyle changes. <br> <br> <br>
                    Evidence from clinical studies supports this approach. For example, research in India showed that patients with melasma who used a broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF 19, PA+++) for 12 weeks experienced significant improvements.<br> <br> <br>
                    Ultimately, robust photoprotection tailored to melasma not only prevents flare-ups but also empowers patients with practical tools to cope with UV-related challenges, improving both treatment results and overall quality of life.<br> <br><br>
